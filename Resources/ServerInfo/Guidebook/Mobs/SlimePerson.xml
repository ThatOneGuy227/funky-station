## Slime core

Slime People have a unique body structure, they do not have the typical set of internal organs most other species do,
rather the [color=yellow]Slime core [/color](located within the stomach region) functions as their brain, heart, eyes, stomach, kidneys and liver.

This core is capable of processing up to 6 reagents at a time compared to just 3 for most other species. 

## Breathing

The only other organ they have are the gas sacs that function as their lungs,
[color=#ffa500]they breathe nitrogen instead of oxygen[/color], which is plentiful in the station, but might be difficult to find in a compressed tank.

They also take[color=#1e90ff] 80% less Asphyxiation [/color]damage.

## Damage

Due to their elastic form they are especialy resistant to blunt force, making them take[color=#1e90ff] 40% less blunt[/color] damage,
but also take [color=#ffa500]20% more Slash and Pierce[/color] damage. 

Their bodies are not suited for cold enviroments making them take [color=#ffa500]50% more cold [/color] damage.

And their unique biology makes them take [color=#1e90ff]20% less Poison and 80% less Cellular[/color]  damage.

[color=#1e90ff]They also begin regenerating health from below 65 damage and do so at nearly twice the rate of other species.[/color] 

Being splashed with water also melts off part of their slime, making them take minor heat damage,
but still can and are required to drink it.  

## Blood

Their slime "blood" can be regenerated from Iron and is technically a source of moderately filling food for other species,
although drinking the blood of your coworkers is usualy frowned upon.
