## Diet
  Moths have an exclusive cloth diet. They cannot eat most things that other species can, however they can eat clothing, gloves and other wearable items.
  In addition, chefs can prepare moth specific food recipes for them.
  
  Due to this they also cannot eat pills without disolving them in water first. 
 
  Their insect blood is metabolised from iron like regular blood. 

## Wings
  Their wings give them better acceleration if there is no gravity on the station, but they still can't move without equipment when floating out in space.
